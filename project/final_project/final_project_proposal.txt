# Final Project Proposal

In this final project, we are looking at S&P 500 stocks in November 2020. We decide to split the project into two parts. Part one is about sentiment analysis on the top 1% and bottom 1% of stocks. We decide to look at the best and worst performers (based on percent change in stock price), and conduct a sentiment analysis using twitter. Part two is about network anlaysis on the 500+ stocks from the S&P 500 list. 

This November is such a historical month, e.g. COVID, election, Dow Jones best month since 1987, Nasdaq best November since 2001 and S&P 500 best November since 1928. We are excited to apply text mining and network analysis to uncover any interesting insight from this volatile month. 

Part Two Details
-- To expand what was already done we will not only look at what was already done for the network analysis piece we will not only be looking at what stock prices move together but also what some leading indicators are the for the market. For example a certain stock going up a certain day signifies that the next day a different stock will have it's price increase or decrease
