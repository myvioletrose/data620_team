The attributes datasets are avaliable directly from the sociopatterns website."

I think we may also output the data and load it into gephi to perform different visualizations in that tool. We are very interested to look at the different types of social positions that are occupied within the social structure of a high school. For example we may find that there are students that don't have a very high degree centrality but do have a high betweeness centrality, meaning that these are people that only have a few friends but their friends are all from different social groups."

One hypothetical outcome from comparing these different metrics across groups is that we would find out whether one gender is more socially connected than the other gender, or when we compare year to year we may find that whether one gender changes their social network more quickly. We may also find similar outcomes when comparing across different classes."
